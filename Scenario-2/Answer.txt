1)	What are different artifacts you need to create - name of the artifacts and its purpose
    A. Based on the build pipeline We should create a build definition (or) tasks like copy files, published build artifacts which will help us to create default drop location for our files (ARM) used during deployment.

2)	List the tools you will to create and store the ARM templates.
    A. Vscode, sublime text, notepad++
    
3)	Explain the process and steps to create automated deployment pipeline. 
    A.
    I)    place your code in repo.
    II)   create build pipeline linking to your repo.
    III)  add task to your build pipeline to create artifacts
    IV)   run the build pipeline
    V)    create a release pipline,
    VI)   link you artifacts to release pipeline.
    VII)  create stage, and add task Azure resource group deployment
    VIII) create a service connection (provide subscription details like subscription name, SPN ID, Secrets, Tenant ID)with azure if already not in place. 
    IX)   select resource group, location to deploy. 
    X)    select Templates file from build artifacts.
    XI)   select parameters files from Buld artifacts if Override template parameters not supplied.
    XII)  save a pipeline and create release.

4) Create a sample ARM template you will use to deploy a Windows VM of any size
   A. jsons files uploaded in repo.
   Note: Depending upon the place you are executing ARM file variable file can be pass through, Resource Deployment, Overwrite variable parameters or of executing from powershell, we can create
         Custom hash table\object.
   
5) Explain how you will access the password stored in Key Vault and use it as Admin Password in the VM ARM template.
   A.please find Below ARM Template adminPassword section, connect to the keyvault and fetch SecretName named as adminPassword and use it as password of resource.


"adminPassword": {
  "reference": {
    "keyVault": {
        "id": "/subscriptions/<subscriptionID>/resourceGroups/<resourceGroupName>/Providers/Microsoft.keyVault/vaults/<KeyVaultName>"
    },
    "SecretName": "adminPassword"
    }
}
